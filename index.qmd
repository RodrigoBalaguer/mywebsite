My research interests address the assessment of global change impacts over forests, with the aim of contributing to the development of adaptive strategies. Under a ecoinformatic perspective, I study the functioning and dynamics of forest ecosystems, and its feed-backs with environmental processes such as rewilding, wildfire activity and carbon balances.
